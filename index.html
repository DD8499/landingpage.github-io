            <p>In local language "Chorwad" means Unpredictable Sand. This Beach is considered to be dangerous because sand on the Beach and inside sea suddenly sinks and there have been several accidents here. That could be one of the reason that the Holiday Camp has been shut down. You can also see here the Chorwad Palace which belonged to Nawab of Junagadh.</p>

Today, Chorwad lays claim to being India's only beach palace resort-the piece de resistance of Gujarat's beaches.
